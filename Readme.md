<strong>Background:</strong><br>
<br>
A cryptocurrency or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Santoshi Nakamoto. It was first released as an open-source software in 2009 and therefore stands as the very first decentralized cryptocurrency. 
When Bitcoin emerged, it only had the support of a handful of enthusiasts. But its steady march toward legitimacy paved the way for further development of blockchain technology, and the birth of numerous other cryptocurrencies. 
The popularity of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 due to several consecutive months of exponential growth of their market capitalization. The prices peaked at more than $800 billion in January 2018.
With more widespread acceptance and adoption, cryptocurrencies have proven to be more than a passing trend. They are now a legitimate asset class within certain investment portfolios.
However, from bitcoin to ether, digital currencies as a whole are complex and unpredictable, exhibit extreme price volatility and can become illiquid at any time. They should be viewed as highly speculative and may result in an entire loss of investment. 
While the demand is evident, many investors, particularly institutional ones, face difficulties in successfully accessing the product and bridge the gap between the underlying decentralized online blockchain technology and traditional investment structures. 
Although machine learning has been successful in predicting stock market prices through a host of different time series models, its application in predicting cryptocurrency prices has been quite restrictive. The reason behind this is obvious as prices of cryptocurrencies depend on a lot of factors like technological progress, internal competition, pressure on the markets to deliver, economic problems, security issues, political factors, etc. Their high volatility leads to the great potential of high profit if intelligent inventing strategies are taken. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indexes, cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial predictions like stock market prediction.
Therefore, in keeping with the impressive demand for an accurate and reliable model for cryptocurrency prediction, this project was designed to facilitate investors (as well as researchers and enthusiasts) in providing a proper tool for analysis of cryptocurrency prices that would aid them in making important financial decisions with respect to fluctuating market values of various cryptos.
